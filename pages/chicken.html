            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Chicken pieces (drumsticks, thighs, wings, or breasts)</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Black pepper</li>
            <li>Optional spices: paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, cayenne pepper</li>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Prepare the chicken</b> <br>
                
                Pat the chicken pieces dry. <br>

                Season them lightly with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li><b>Marinate (optional but very helpful)</b> <br>

                Place chicken in a bowl and cover with buttermilk. <br>

                Add a bit of salt, pepper, and optional hot sauce. <br>

                Let it rest for at least 1 hour or up to overnight in the fridge.</li>
                <li><b>Prepare the coating</b> <br>

                In a large bowl, mix flour, optional cornstarch, salt, pepper, and any spices you like. <br>

                This is your crispy coating.</li>
            <li><b>Coat the chicken</b> <br>
                
                Remove each piece from the marinade and let excess drip off. <br>
                
                Dredge it in the flour mixture, pressing the flour onto the chicken to form a thick coating. <br>
                
                Place coated pieces on a tray and let them rest for 10–15 minutes (this helps the crust stick).</li>
            <li><b>Heat the oil</b> <br>

                Fill a large pot or deep pan with enough oil to submerge the chicken halfway. <br>
                
                Heat to about 350°F (175°C).
                
                If you don't have a thermometer, test by dropping a small piece of flour mixture in — it should bubble immediately.</li>
            <li><b>Fry the chicken</b> <br>

                Carefully place chicken pieces into the hot oil. <br>
                
                Fry in batches; don’t overcrowd the pan.
                
                Cook for about 12–15 minutes, turning halfway through, until golden brown and cooked through.</li>
                <li><b>Drain & serve</b><br>
                Remove chicken and place on a wire rack or paper towels to drain excess oil. <br>
                Let rest for a few minutes before serving so it stays crisp.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Tips</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Use bone-in, skin-on chicken for the juiciest results.</li>
            <li>Resting the coated chicken before frying helps prevent the crust from falling off.</li>
            <li>Cornstarch in the flour mix makes the crust extra crunchy.</li>
            <li>Keep the oil between 325–350°F (165–175°C). Too low = soggy, too high = burnt outside + raw inside.</li>
            <li>Don't cover fried chicken with foil—it traps steam and softens the crust.</li>
            <li>Season the chicken right after frying for extra flavor.</li>
        </ul>
